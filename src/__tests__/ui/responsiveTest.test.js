 * Manual responsive testing checklist
 *
 * These tests need to be run manually to verify responsive design across devices.
 * You can use browser DevTools to simulate different screen sizes.
 *
 * Viewport sizes to test:
 * - Extra small: 375px (iPhone SE), 390px (iPhone 12), 412px (Pixel 6)
 * - Small: 480px (Small mobile landscape)
 * - Tablet: 768px (iPad Mini), 834px (iPad Pro), 1024px (iPad Pro Landscape)
 * - Desktop: 1280px, 1440px, 1920px
 * - Ultra-wide: 2560px, 3440px (21:9 ultrawide)
 *
 * Pages to test:
 * - Landing page
 * - Login/Signup
 * - Dashboard
 * - Admin pages
 * - Strategies page
 * - Profile page
 * - Settings pages

 *
 * For each page, verify:
 * ✓ Layout doesn't break (no horizontal scrolling)

 * ✓ Buttons and inputs are usable and properly sized
 * ✓ Navigation works correctly (menu collapses on small screens)
 * ✓ Modals appear correctly and are usable

 * ✓ Images scale appropriately
 * ✓ Touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile
 * ✓ All interactive elements have proper focus states
 * ✓ No content is cut off or hidden unintentionally
 * ✓ Cards and grid layouts adapt to screen size
 * ✓ Long text wraps correctly (URLs, emails, etc.)
 * ✓ Header and footer adapt properly
 * ✓ Spacing is consistent and appropriate for each device
 *
 * Specific interaction tests:
 * ✓ Form validation errors display properly on all devices
 * ✓ Dropdown menus and popovers position correctly
 * ✓ Hover states have touch equivalents
 * ✓ Scrollable areas have appropriate touch momentum
 * ✓ No elements overlap when keyboard appears on mobile
 * ✓ Date pickers and specialized inputs work on all devices
